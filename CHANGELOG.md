## [2.5.3] - 2025-01-20

### 🎯 MAJOR FIX: Removed Restrictive Account Filtering
- **FIXED**: Wizard now shows ALL accounts from your Instantly workspace
- **REMOVED**: Overly restrictive "verified" status filtering that excluded valid accounts
- **IMPROVED**: Trusts Instantly API - any returned account is considered usable
- **RESOLVED**: "No verified sending accounts found" error for workspaces with pre-loaded accounts

### 🔧 What Changed
- ✅ **Step 1**: Now calls `/accounts` and shows ALL returned accounts
- ✅ **No filtering**: Removed `status === 'active' || status === 'verified'` restrictions
- ✅ **Better messaging**: Changed from "verified accounts" to "available accounts"
- ✅ **Trust API**: If Instantly returns an account, it's available for use
- ✅ **Complete tool registration**: Both definition and implementation properly connected

### 🧙‍♂️ Wizard Behavior Now
1. **Step 1 (`start`)**: Shows ALL accounts from your workspace
2. **Step 2 (`info_gathered`)**: Validates campaign information
3. **Step 3 (`create`)**: Creates campaign with any selected account
4. **No restrictions**: Uses whatever accounts Instantly provides

### 💡 For Users with Pre-loaded Workspaces
- ✅ **Works immediately**: No need to verify accounts separately
- ✅ **Shows all accounts**: Pre-configured accounts are now visible
- ✅ **No false errors**: Won't claim "no accounts found" when accounts exist
- ✅ **Streamlined workflow**: Use any account returned by the API

## [2.5.2] - 2025-01-20

- **TESTED**: Both tool definition and implementation properly connected

### 🔧 What's Fixed

- ✅ Complete wizard implementation added to request handler
- ✅ All 3 steps (start, info_gathered, create) fully functional
- ✅ Account validation and error prevention working
- ✅ Clear guidance and helpful error messages
- ✅ Backward compatibility with `create_campaign` maintained

### 🧙‍♂️ Wizard Features Now Working
- **Step 1 (`start`)**: Checks verified sending accounts automatically

- **Step 3 (`create`)**: Creates campaign with validated data
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages for missing accounts, fields, or API issues
- **Configuration Preview**: Shows settings before campaign creation
